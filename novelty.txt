Novelty (<=100 words):
This methods paper fixes a proof‑verified “Reality Bridge” that maps dimensionless derivations to SI displays with no tunable parameters. It proves non‑circularity (unit relabelings factor out), uniqueness at the stated symmetry, and introduces two independent SI landings (time‑first and length‑first) evaluated by a single predeclared inequality with explicit uncertainty/correlation. The result is a falsifiable, audit‑ready interface from theorem to instrument that requires no sector models, fits, thresholds, or priors and includes a reproducibility pack (Lean theorem hooks, one‑command builds, deterministic display calculator).
