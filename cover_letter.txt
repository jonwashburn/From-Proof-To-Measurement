Dear Editors,

Please find enclosed our manuscript “From Proof to Measurement: A Reality Bridge with Falsifiable SI Landings”.

The paper introduces a proof‑verified semantics that carries a dimensionless derivation layer into SI displays without introducing tunable parameters. It proves non‑circularity, uniqueness at the stated symmetry, and provides two independent SI landings tested by a single predeclared inequality with explicit uncertainty and correlation. No sector models or fits are used. A complete reproducibility pack (Lean theorem hooks, one‑command builds, deterministic display calculator) is included.

We believe the methods and audit trail are aligned with Metrologia’s mission on rigor in measurement science.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Washburn (@jonwashburn)
